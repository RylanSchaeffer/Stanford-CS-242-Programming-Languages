// that you think will be helpful to the struct definitions.
// Below shows the signature of the methods needed across the TCP client state machine.
// Note that not all methods may be implemented for every typestate struct.
//
//   pub fn new() -> T
//   pub fn send_syn(self, _: &mut Server) -> Result<T,T>
//   pub fn send_ack(self, _: &mut Server) -> T

//   pub fn send_close(self, _: &mut Server) -> Result<T,T>
//   pub fn ids_sent(&self) -> Vec<u32>
//
// Here T denotes a type. Note that each T can be a different type.
